let's test dangerous staff on git, before messing up the importante repositories

Ahah, that's going to be fun

I tried 
<code> git push --set-upsteram origin b1 </code>
to see here b1 would be mapped, 
<code> git branch -a </code>
outputed: 
<code>
* b1
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/b1
  remotes/origin/master
</code>
